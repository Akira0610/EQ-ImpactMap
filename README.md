## Introduction
Global‚ÄØEarthquake‚ÄØRealtime‚ÄØVisualization‚ÄØPlatform is an interactive web application that integrates real‚Äëtime earthquake data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Built with FastAPI, Pydeck, and Mapbox, the platform lets users filter earthquakes by magnitude, time, and region while exploring them on an interactive map that updates in real time.  
Data Source: USGS Earthquake Catalog

## Installation
1. install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Start the backend server
```
java -cp out EarthquakeFetcher
cd python-api
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
3. Open your browser and navigate to <http://localhost:8000/map>

## Usage
- Real‚Äëtime retrieval of global earthquake events
- Search by magnitude, time range, and location
- Dynamically updating deck.gl¬†+ Mapbox map
- Tooltips with detailed earthquake information
- Full map interaction (zoom, pan, rotate)

## Tech Stack
### Client
  - Users access the site with a standard web browser.
  - Static assets (HTML¬†/‚ÄØJS‚ÄØ/‚ÄØCSS) are served by FastAPI.
  - FastAPI Router `page_map.py /map`delivers the map page.`/map`.  
### Earthquake Data Fetching
  - Java service periodically pulls the latest data from the USGS feed.
  - Data are pre‚Äëprocessed and stored for the API.
  - Main module: `java-fetcher`.  
### API Services
  - **FastAPI (Python)** ‚Äì  provides a RESTful API(/earthquakes) returning JSON.
  - Main routers`earthquake.py`.  
### Map Rendering and Interaction
  - Pydeck + Mapbox visualise earthquakes as markers.
  - Tooltips reveal magnitude, depth, location, and UTC timestamp.
  - Map generation: `map_generator.py`  
### Fronted Interactionand Search
  - `main.js` handles the search form, client‚Äëside validation, and API calls.
  - User queries trigger map refreshes with filtered data.
